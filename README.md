# Addressing the Psychometric Challenges from Digital Learning and Assessment: How Computational psychometrics Helps

> Pre-conference training workshop on computational psychometrics for EdTech-CP-Summit 2022.

In this repository, I included the slides and example codes (jupyter notebooks) of the workshop. Please check out the code examples in the codes directory. For questions, please contact <jhao@ets.org>.
## Learning Goals of this Workshop (1.5 hour)

* Learn the promises of process data for digital assessments with examples.
* Understand what is computational psychometrics and why we need it.
* Get a high-level understanding of some prioritized methodological areas of computational psychometrics with hands-on examples:
    * Data Science
        - Data science basics
        - Data wrangling and processing
        - Interactive visualization and dashboarding
    * Machine Learning
        - Supervised learning
        - Unsupervised learning
        - Software for machine learning: Scikit-learn and Orange
